# Welcome to my First Step Project
This project is for the Individual Study under P'toto (myCourseVille) supervisation üôèüôè during my time at Chulalongkorn University Year 3 2022/1. It is my first serious Front End Web Application created with React. The accompanying Back End API written in Laravel is [here](https://github.com/noWarm/LMS-backend).

Managing between **RUSHING** to learn and understand the Web technologies to make this project while also taking six other University subjects was surely a big mistake and it cost me my sanity. This was a mistake but I'm glad I paid the price and pulled through. I also learned from many more mistakes (see link below for details)

## Features 
- Users (students & teachers) can register, login & logout of the system
- Users stays logged in the application within 1 hour if they didn't logout
- Teachers can create new Courses
- Teachers can create new Materials for each Courses by uploading a File
- Teachers can download the uploaded Material Files
- The system will display a "Loading" message while fetching data from the back end.

## Techniques Learnt
- state and props
- useState, useEffect
- useContext, useProvider
- router, navigation, redirect
- localStorage
- conditional rendering
- reusing and DRY code

## Development Lessons Learnt
- stick to the planned diagrams/schemas, otherwise scope creep (and eventually EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!)
- list out all the functional requirements (both todo and the NOT gonna dos)
- quickly rolled out a working prototype as fast as possible instead of going down the refactoring hole
- learnt to prioritize structure over decorations
- choose tools based on pros/cons matrix instead of gut feeling/trends
- learnt to read documents and asked for help
