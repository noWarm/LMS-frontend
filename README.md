# Welcome to my First Step Project
This project is for the Individual Study under P'toto (myCourseVille) supervisation 🙏🙏 during my time at Chulalongkorn University Year 3 2022/1. It is my first serious Front End Web Application created with React. The accompanying Back End API written in Laravel is [here]().

Managing between **RUSHING** to learn and understand the Web technologies to make this project while also taking six other University subjects was surely a big mistake and it cost me my sanity. This was a mistake but I'm glad I paid the price and pulled through. I also learned from many more mistakes (see link below for details)
